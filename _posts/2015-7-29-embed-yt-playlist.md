title: Embedding YouTube Playlist
---

__Edit: The playlist is removed for the time being because it is not responsive which is not a good fit with this responsive layout. Maybe it's time to do some responsive sleuthing...__

The new experiment involves embedding entire YouTube playlist on Drupal.

That is as easy as creating a new block, set the Text Format to Full HTML, and copy and paste the Embed code from YouTube when you're at the playlist.

I have also removed the slideshow from the Multipurpose layout because it looks too busy to have a slide show and a YouTube video screen on the front page. So see you later, slideshow.
