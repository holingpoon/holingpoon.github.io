title: Disable Mutagen
---

Hear me out before throwing things at me ðŸ’€

Sometimes when one does `ddev start`, it will fail with the following message

```
Starting Mutagen sync process...
Failed to start d11-site: failed to CreateOrResumeMutagenSync on Mutagen sync session 'd11-site'.
```

And when `ddev mutagen reset` didn't do the trick, I did a little research on what does Mutagen really do. It is performance related. So depending on how performance matter to you during local development, it's okay to disable Mutagen.

```
ddev mutagen reset && ddev config global --performance-mode=none && ddev config --performance-mode=none
```
