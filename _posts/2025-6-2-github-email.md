title: Github Email is a serious
---

Git and Github takes your email a lot more seriously than you think.

I found out that my Github profile only counts my contribution if my Github email matches
the one I have when I configure it on the commandline with

`git config user.email`

So don't forget to `git config user.email <your email on Github>`
