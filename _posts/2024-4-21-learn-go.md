`go mod init .` ⬅️ Doesn't work with `.`

`go mod init helloworld.go` ⬅️ go.mod will be populated in `.`

Been forgetting about building and running on command line 😅

`go run ./helloworld.go` ⬅️ Displays Hello, 世界

`go build ./helloworld.go` ⬅️ Builds compilation file

`./helloworld` ⬅️ Displays Hello, 世界
