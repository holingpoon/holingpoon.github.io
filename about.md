Ho-Ling Poon roams from the great city of Brooklyn, New York, where she spent many years studying, and never seized to be amazed how many great concepts that once were in science fiction and computer science textbooks turned into science reality.
 
As a Systems Specialist, Ho-Ling spent 12 years at the American Museum of Natural History seeking and implementing solutions for researchers at the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation. Her knowledge she gained at the museum gave her great foundation in understanding and continuously learning of data needs for the New York Public Library. She is currently a Senior DevOps Engineer, working on the deployments of the libraryâ€™s website, nypl.org.
 
Determined to be a life-long learner, Ho-Ling, with her background in systems administration and digital archives, moved on to pursuing a second career in web development, followed by DevOps, at the New York Public Library.
 
Ho-Ling's non-computer interests including but not limited to Taekwondo, Karaoke, and dancing badly to her favorite songs.
